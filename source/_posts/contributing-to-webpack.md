This article explains in easy terms how to be able to contribute to webpack. The post is not long, but will give you an indication of what to do to get your contributions submited.

## Documentation

Webpack has its own documentation repository and is probably one of the easiest ways to start on your journey as a webpack maintainer. Browse through the issues list, look for good contribution labeled issues or read some of the issues anyway. You can also look in any of webpacks repositories that isn't the main documentation repository. Look for typos, maybe some feature isn't documented yet. Use your intuition.

## Code

While code i a big part of webpack moving forward, the code also needs to be documented and new features should be shared with an audience either through Social Media, or by creating documents internally in each repository. The best way to get started writing code, is to learn the exsisting code, setting breakpoints and debugging yourself.

A neat trick, is also to read issues, try to solve those issues yourself or read up about what people are struggling with.

## Community

Being active in the webpack community, writing content and advocating is fun. You dont need to have a lot of followers, just create good content and the followers will appear. This could be things like one-liners that are cool, use cases of webpack and/or other exciting things you discover one can do with the tool.

## Summary

Try contributing to webpack, it will make your profile more attractive and being involved in a community is super-rewarding. Send me a DM if there's anything in this article that doesn't make sense.
