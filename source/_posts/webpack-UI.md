Navigating the webpack landscape is often hard. You don't know what to put in your configuration or how it should be done. With webpack UI, I hope to make it easier for people to create or manage their webpack configurations.

## Brief Introduction

Webpack UI is a scaffolding website made to make it easier for people to create or manage their configurations. With the UI, you are able to modify existing configurations, create new ones or choose templates that will generate best practise configurations for you. This project needs sponsoring though. If you want to support me, consider donating [here](https://github.com/sponsors/evenstensberg)
